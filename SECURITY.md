# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The security of MentalEase-Backend is our top priority. Given the sensitive nature of mental health data, we take all security concerns seriously.

### Reporting Process

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred):
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/jazil10/MentalEase-Backend/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

2. **Direct Contact**:
   - Email: security@mentalease.com (if available)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed description and reproduction steps

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Varies based on severity
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is ready

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow secure coding practices
- Conduct security reviews for all changes
- Keep dependencies updated

### For Deployment

- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement proper logging (without sensitive data)

## üè• HIPAA Compliance

Given the mental health focus, this project aims for HIPAA compliance:

### Technical Safeguards
- Access controls and unique user identification
- Automatic logoff and encryption controls
- Audit controls and integrity controls
- Person or entity authentication
- Transmission security

### Administrative Safeguards
- Security management process
- Assigned security responsibility
- Workforce training and access management
- Information system activity review
- Security awareness and training
- Security incident procedures
- Contingency plan
- Regular security evaluations

### Physical Safeguards
- Facility access controls
- Workstation security
- Device and media controls

## üìä Vulnerability Disclosure

### Severity Levels

**Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**
- Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- Response time: 24 hours
- Public disclosure: After fix is deployed

**High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**
- Significant security risk
- Response time: 72 hours
- Public disclosure: 1 week after fix

**Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**
- Moderate security risk
- Response time: 1 week
- Public disclosure: 2 weeks after fix

**Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**
- Minor security concern
- Response time: 2 weeks
- Public disclosure: 1 month after fix

## üîç Security Auditing

### Regular Audits
- Monthly dependency vulnerability scans
- Quarterly code security reviews
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous monitoring for security issues

### Automated Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Security-focused CI/CD pipelines
- Automated security testing
